# HashSpidey

A sloppy implementation of [joeyAghion's Spidey](https://github.com/joeyAghion/spidey) abstract web crawling, using in-memory Hash to save pages and links. Very smelly and unstable until I figure out the best API.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'hash_spidey'

    $ bundle

    $ gem install hash_spidey
